Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The predictions may not necessarily prove incorrect as the number of simulations is increased,
as the outcome of each simulation is determined by the ratings of the teams and the random nature of the simulate_game function.
However, with a larger number of simulations, the results are likely to be more accurate and reliable in estimating the probability of each team winning the tournament.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: ----
